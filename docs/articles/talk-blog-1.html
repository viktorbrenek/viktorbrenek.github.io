<p>Hello! If you are reading this i am probably dead… hopefully not lol. But
socialy its quite probable. This is actually my first blog post outside of development
series. While writing those lines i am amuzed of myself. Keeping a blog will be
definetly hard since i am not able to post anything on my social media in time.
So please… dont expect me to amuze you every day on time. You know… maybe just
check in once in a month :D Anyways… these “side talks” will be focused more
on my personal life, but i dont want to bother you with bullshit. So i will try
to add something usefull to each of my blog posts. Today i have got something small,
but maybe it can help you with your website :)</p>
<h2>Something usefull?</h2>
<p>So you might be wondering… How that ape get this cool website online? And how come hes
actually not paying anything for it! SHOCKER! Well me and my collegue <a href="https://hruska.design/">Daniel Hruška</a> have
found some cool ideas in the depths of github. There is actually a very smart german web designer
whos using this javascript compiler, that can actually compile your blog posts written in
markdown into html5 files. “OK CHAMP - So you have got very primitive backend and how come
you dont pay shit?” Well Johny github is actually quite usefull in that matter, you can
create up to ONE personal website and host it completly free on your profile. Only thing
you actually need to setup (if you want too) and pay for (a little bit) is your own personal
domain. “But you said FREE damn you!” Well… if you dont have 250 pesos/year you are fucked yea.
Sorry about that.
