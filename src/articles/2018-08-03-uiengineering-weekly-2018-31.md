## [Evolving a Design System at Scale](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/evolving-a-design-system-at-scale-88aa2f249525)

Liz Khoo describes how the Salesforce UX team uses cross-product themes to update their design system.

> Getting this consistency into product is its own journey for each product team. Once the UX team is aligned internally, each product team must address this “trust debt” (aka design debt) and make the necessary changes.
