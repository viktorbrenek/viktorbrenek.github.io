## I dont even bother to apologize again
Hi.
Oops i did it again. I wasnt posting much. I know. If you are a regular "refresher" of my
website you must feel disappointed. However i was posting on my discord atleast. And i 
made some progress on the game. So in todays blogpost i will summerize last two months,
which had been really chaotic. I was highly focused towards growing the community on 
my youtube around gaming content which i hope will pay on in the future when i will 
finally release this mutant child of mine. 
#
## Mechanics
Nope nothing new here, sadly. 
However i do have a few ideas for the future. For example about the death penalties and 
regeneration penalties. Right now if you die in the game. Nothing happens. You simply 
respawn on the "graveyard" point (which is a location setup manually). In the future i have
been thinking about reducing the max health value temporarily. Maybe even things like energy
or your posture value which would lead in more dangerous situations in the world. 
There are still some plans for critical injuries like a limb amputee. But i am not sure how
to do that right now. Maybe a small % chance to get critically damaged which would force you
into a replacement via some movement speed penalty (when a leg is damaged) or attack speed
penalty (when an arm is damaged). 
#
Also i have started watching a youtube channel of Timothy Cain, who led Troika game studio 
back in 2000 and stood behind projects like Arcanum (my favourite game) and Temple of Elemental
Evil. This guy is highly descripable by a two words "knowlage" and "experience"... he is really
an inspiration for me in terms of the game development.
So i might refine the game with some of ideas that he inspired me with. 
#
For example i am really thinking about deviding the game into 4 biomes. A desert inspired by 
Tula Desert from Arcanum and also from Kenshi. A swamp that just seems cool to me and i might
include some meadows in it, because i like the appearance of Outwards meadows areas. A bunker 
biom which would lead you to the underground system of tunnels and caves where a great and ancient
culture used to reside before the mysterious events wiped them all, which is kinda also inspired by
Arcanum, but also by an Apple TV Series called "Silo". And lastly an ocean biom which would just 
be a cool vast place to explore on a ship (not sure if i will be able to do something like that). 
This last biom would definitely mean that i would have to remake the whole character controller
or use some other asset from Unity Store. And let me be clear... this is not an easy task. 
So i am kinda scared to do that right now in the middle of development. So if this idea will proof
to be to much work i might do the "meadows" sub idea into the whole separete biom. 
#
There are also some news regarding the building system WIP. The modular way is definitely something
that i would like to implement in some way. But also i am thinking about more like "city builder" 
style, where a player could build the whole building without needing to place down each separete
wall. Which is cool... dont take me wrong. But its definitely not for everybody who just wants
to play an rpg and maybe have something extra like a colony which is automated and serves both
as a home but perhaps maybe also a material production, or something like that. These buildings 
could also be upgraded to produce more materials, or to produce them quicker. So it would be kinda
similar to the old school browser games where you could do something like that. But also... 
i would still like to have options like building a containers for your loot, or wardrobe for your
clothes etc. So this element would persist. 
#
I have milions of ideas and things that i would like to add or improve. The problem is time and 
the fact, that i might not be able to include them all. So I will try to focus and make some 
to-do list, which would maybe help me to stay more on track and less distracted by the world full
of possibilities.  
#
## I have been modeling! 
#
Even though it might seem that i spent more time thinking than working i actually added a lot
of new things. Specificaly a new animal, new monster and a new enemy race, which also has 2 sub-variants.
Other then that i have also remodeled all the weapons, building and few other stuff.  
#
Firstly lets talk about the new wildlife. 
This is a bird. I dont have a name now. Its neutral if you dont attack it. Similar to the goatzellas, 
the birds are just simple animals which will serve as a material source, but also provide a small
amounts of XP. Maybe even be tamable in the future or rideable. The animations are terrible. But 
nothing that cannot be upgraded in the future.

There is also a new monster! The spider! Yea.. how original. The reason why i used them is simple.
Its a typical monster in all the rpgs i have ever played. But also i wanted to reintroduce the 
old school mythical race of Arachnes. Which had been present in few rpgs based on DnD. They
are usually mutated humanoids with a half body of a human female where the head of the spider
whould be. So logically i wanted to model a spider which proofed to be easy, but animation 
was impossible for my level of knowlage. So i just bought it... yea the model of the spider 
is an asset. Which i atleast adjusted to my needs. It came with full set of animation which 
are just next level and the monster looks just sooo much good in the world. 
#
So the spider wasnt the first idea but i am keeping it. The Arachne race was a little bit
harder since you practically need to combine animation of upper body from human and the 
rest of the spider skeleton. Proofed to be impossible for me. After 3 days i just made 
my own version of Arachnes. Which have the spider legs attached on the back. They can use
them offensively and they are kinda responsive to the movement of the hands, but it looks fine
and little bit scary, so i think its ok to leave it like that. I event made them possible 
to wear an armor. Specifically they can be naked, or have a ninja armor or wear a nomad armor. 
They will be residing only in the desert biom and they will have both the ranged attacks with the
bow but also some cool melee strikes with their spider legs. So ofc the AI will be little more
complicated, but most of it is already working. I will also group them with the basic spiders
which i have made larger and really fast. So while you are fighting (or running away from)
a spider the Arachnes will shoot you from distance. These fights will present a harder 
experience and some challange.

## Weapons redefined 
Also i have remodeled the weapons. Most of them are un-equippable right now. But i have added 
a looot of new variants and i feel good about them. Especially the ranged steampunk guns turned
really nice. Specially the rifle and the flamethrower. Each weapon "type" will also have its own
set of combat movement.

#
## Building redefined
In the similar fashion i have also remodeled the buildings. Most of them are just my older models
which i have cleared out, remeshed, and retextured to be more optimized for my game and the whole
new design. All of the buildings are fully walkable for both player and the AI. So NPCs can freely
walk between the building levels via stairs etc. The player can also jump out of the windows or
from the rooftops.
