## [Design systems](https://adactio.com/journal/13844)

Jeremy Keith stresses the point that a design system encompassed more than a set of components:

> Just because you have a collection of design patterns doesn’t mean you have a design system.
> A system is a framework. It’s a rulebook. It’s what tells you how those patterns work together.

## [Developing a design environment](https://medium.com/credit-karma-design/developing-a-design-environment-30c6276eb89f)

In this article Jules Forrest talks about his learnings from trying to establish an optimal set of processes and tools to design software products.
It covers a designers view of how the tooling (especially Sketch) can be used and could be improved.

## [When NOT to Use a Design System](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/when_not_to_use_a_design_system)

While design systems can be tremendously valuable they're not a one-size-fits-all solution.
Bryan Braun lists some cases in which a design system may not be what you really need.

> Designers and developers will likely be biased toward building design systems.
> It’s fun, visible greenfield work, which solves pain points for their peers.
> But at the end of the day, somebody has to make sure it makes business sense.

## [Design Systems Repo](https://designsystemsrepo.com/)

This website is a frequently updated collection of examples, articles, tools and talks about Design Systems.
It curates a comprehensive list of style guides and pattern libraries, as well as tools and resources.
